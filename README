Linux kernel
============

/******************************************************************Consort Digital Pvt Ltd**********************************************************************************/ 

***** This Kernel release will be used in TRCP 5207 to enable Touchscreen support for Newhaven "NHD-7.0-1024600AF-LSXP-CTP" ******

Procedure
Steps
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install git build-essential flex bison device-tree-compiler
$ git clone https://github.com/gateworks/linux-imx6 -b gateworks_5.4.45
$ cd linux-imx6
^^^ now edit arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6qdl-gw52xx.dtsi with following changes
 polytouch: edt-ft5x06@38 {
                compatible = "edt,edt-ft5406", "edt,edt-ft5x06";
                pinctrl-names = "default";
+               pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_touch>;
                reg = <0x38>;
                interrupt-parent = <&gpio7>;
                interrupts = <12 2>;
                wakeup-gpios = <&gpio7 12 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
        };
         accel@1e {
                compatible = "nxp,fxos8700";
                reg = <0x1e>;
        };
         pinctrl_touch: touchgrp {
+               fsl,pins = <
+                       MX6QDL_PAD_SD2_CMD__GPIO1_IO11          0x1b0b0
+               >;
+       };
+
        pinctrl_uart1: uart1grp {
                fsl,pins = <
                        MX6QDL_PAD_SD3_DAT7__UART1_TX_DATA      0x1b0b1
        };
        
$ ARCH=arm make gwventana_defconfig
$ ARCH=arm make dtbs
^^^ Note you don't need a cross-compiler as your not actually building the kernel, just the dtbs so all you need is ARCH=arm and the dtc app
$ ls arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6*gw52xx.dtb
     arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6dl-gw52xx.dtb
     arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6q-gw52xx.dtb


Now copy those two dtb's to your target system. Boot your target and copy the updated dtbs to the /boot directory and sync your fs then reboot. For example:
$ cd /boot
$ wget http://<server>/<path>/imx6q-gw52xx.dtb -O imx6q-gw52xx.dtb
$ wget http://<server>/<path>/imx6dl-gw52xx.dtb -O imx6dl-gw52xx.dtb
(you can use WinScp to copy files direcltly)
$ sync
$reboot

After rebooting you should see the edt-ft5x06 driver register a Linux input device as /dev/input/event* and you should be able to use the 'evtest' app to see touch events.


If you do not see a /dev/input/event* then you can debug the I2C issue with following commands
$ dmesg
$ ls -l /sys/class/input/
$ ls -l /dev/input/

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
